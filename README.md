# Odin Rock Paper Scissors

An asinged project in The Odin Project. I got the idea from the projects that have been posted by the participants in the odin project. But I added a twist I happen to know a game similar to Rock Paper Scissors from Indonesia called suten so I decided to make that instead of rock paper scissors.
