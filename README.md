## Description

An asinged project in The Odin Project. It's just basic html, css, and javascript this is the first project that got me introduced into git, github, and vanilla html, css and javascript, a basic rock paper scisors but I added a twist I happen to know a game similar to Rock Paper Scissors from Indonesia called suten so I decided to make that instead of rock paper scissors but the logic is still the same.
