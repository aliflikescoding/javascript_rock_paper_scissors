            <p>Suten, sut or popular as suit (suwit) and pingsut are ways of drawing lots for two people by pitting their fingers to determine who wins. In children's games, the winner of the sut can play first or be freed from guarding. Instead of lottery, suten is used to determine who gets something, or who can start something first.
            </p>
            <h4>Rules:</h4>
            <p>
            The fingers used in sut are the thumb which represents an elephant, the index finger which is represents a human, and the pinky which represents an ant. Two people who (in this case a computer) "bersuten" simultaneously raised their chosen finger. A draw occurs when both sides of the tie raise a finger of the same strength, for example: pinky finger against pinky finger. If there is a draw, the match is repeated until there is a winner.
